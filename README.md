This repository contains the data for the [Le Data 2.0 (Trends in the Programming World)](https://github.com/aggarwalc/le-data-2.0) project.

## Contributing 
If you would like to update the data, follow the instructions below.

### Stack Overflow
The Stack Overflow data was gathered using the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/).
To compose a new query navigate to the compose query button as seen below.

<br> For each folder inside the Stack-Overflow folder...
1. Copy the contents of the SQL file and paste it into your new query
2. Replace the CSV file in the folder with the new CSV file that your query returns
3. Make sure the names of the new CSV file is the same as the old one!

### GitHub
The GitHub data was gathered through Web Scraping.

### LinkedIn
The LinkedIn data was gathered through Web Scraping as well. 
To update the data, simply run the python program located in the LinkedIn program. If you run into an index error, run the program again until the program executes without an issue. I will be searching for a fix to this problem.
